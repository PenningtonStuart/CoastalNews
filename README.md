# April Fools' Fake News Website

Welcome to our April Fools' Fake News Website repository! This project is a lighthearted prank designed for April Fools' Day, where we create a mock news website filled with humorous and completely fabricated stories. The aim is to entertain and bring a smile to people's faces on this playful occasion.

## How It Works

The fake news website is built using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript for interactive elements. Each story on the website is entirely fictional and created solely for entertainment purposes. From outrageous headlines to absurd articles, the content is crafted to tickle funny bones and elicit a chuckle from visitors.

## Usage

Feel free to clone this repository and customize the fake news website to your liking. Add your own ridiculous stories, create funny images, or tweak the design to enhance the prank. Remember to keep it light-hearted and in good taste.

To view the fake news website locally, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can also host it on GitHub Pages or any other web hosting service for others to enjoy.

## Contributing

## Disclaimer

Please note that the content of this fake news website is entirely fictional and should not be taken seriously. It's meant to be a harmless prank for April Fools' Day, and we do not endorse spreading false information or misleading others. Remember to always use good judgment and consider the feelings of others when participating in pranks or jokes.
